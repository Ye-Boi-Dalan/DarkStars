        A world where no one is hurt? Don't be absurd.<br>
        9-10-19<br>
        There will be no absolution.<br>
        9-9-19<br>
        My bet's on the dirt.<br>
        9-8-19<br>
        I used to joke that he had been exiled for being too smart. Now I know why he never laughed.<br>
        9-7-19<br>
        To be honest, I’m not quite sure what’s going to happen.<br>
        9-6-19<br>
        The panic is amusing, but the real fun comes when the spell passes and the villagers start looking for a scapegoat.<br>
        9-5-19<br>
        One moment, conscious only of a sense of repose. The next moment, hearing the trudge of his own footsteps. He sighed and squinted into the glare ahead.<br>
        9-4-19<br>
        Once I realize how insignificant I am, everything seems to feel better.
        9-3-19<br>
        It's fun. I don't need another reason.<br>
        9-2-19<br>
        If I could stuff your doltish head with knowledge, I’d do it just so someone else could fully comprehend what your stubbornness has cost me!<br>
        9-1-19<br>
        Behold, blessed perfection.<br>
        8-30-19<br>
        It's been a while since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do.<br>
        8-29-19<br>
        For even the very wise cannot see all ends.<br>
        8-28-19<br>
        Not all tears are an evil.<br>
        8-27-19<br>
        One hundred cowards are the same as one.<br>
        8-26-19<br>
        Careful. Payback's a bitch.<br>
        8-25-19<br>
        Win or lose, this is the path I've chosen.<br>
        8-24-19<br>
        Running away is even worse than losing. Unless one continues to fight, without succumbing to the pain of defeat, it is impossible to achieve victory.<br>
        8-23-19<br>
        Even if you lovingly collect every last piece of a shattered cup, pieces are still pieces. Once something breaks, it can never return.<br>
        8-22-19<br>
        People are...weak creature.<br>
        8-21-19<br>
        I hate taking advice from dwarves, but you’re right.<br>

        With all due respect, I'll let you be the one who cuts his head off.<br>

        It's not like crabs can grow wristwatches or anything.<br>

        I'm not saying it was Rahab, but it was Rahab.<br>
        8-17-19<br>
        The interaction of men and women isn’t very logical.<br>
        8-16-19<br>
        The reason he seems so withdrawn is because he’s afraid of being hurt.<br>
        8-15-19<br>
        This is your home now, so make yourself comfortable. And take advantage of everything here, except me.<br>
        8-14-19<br>
        So fucking what if I’m not you?! That doesn’t mean it’s okay for you to give up! God knows I’m not perfect either. I’ve made tons of stupid mistakes and later I regretted them. And I’ve done it over and over again, thousands of times. But even so, every time, I learn something about myself.<br>
        8-13-19<br>
        Mankind’s greatest fear is Mankind itself.<br>
        8-12-19<br>
        I still don’t know where to find happiness. But I’ll continue to think about whether it’s good to be here… whether it was good to have been born. But in the end, it’s just realizing the obvious over and over again.<br>
        8-11-19<br>
        If people sat outside and looked at the stars each night, I'll bet they'd live a lot differently.<br>
        8-10-19<br>
        I suppose if we couldn't laugh at the things that don't make sense, we couldn't react to a lot of life.<br>
        8-9-19<br>
        A whole cheese pizza, all to myself.<br>
        8-8-19<br>
        In my opinion, we don't devote nearly enough scientific research to finding a cure for jerks.<br>
        8-7-19<br>
        There's never enough tume to do all the nothing you want.<br>
        8-6-19<br>
        I'm killing time while I wait for life to shower me with meaning and happiness.<br>
        8-5-19<br>
        Sometimes when I'm talking, my words can't keep up with my thoughts. I wonder why we think faster than we speak. Probably so we can think twice.<br>
        8-4-19<br>
        You know what's weird? Day by day, nothing seems to change, but pretty soon...everything's different.<br>
        8-3-19<br>
        Oh, you people are <i>fucked</i>.<br>
        8-2-19<br>
        If I had three wishes, I'd wish for a warm blanket, someone to share it with, and something to use my third wish on.<br>

        You've been through a lot of shit already, haven't you? Get some rest.<br>
        7-30-19<br>
        Also, being fed orally by an unknown woman is just uncomfortable.<br>
        7-29-19<br>
        Let's start this neoclassical bullshit.<br>
        7-28-19<br>
        The true genius shudders at incompleteness, and usually prefers silence to saying something which is not everything it should be.<br>
        7-27-19<br>
        That was all tight as fuck, but are you gonna explain any of that?<br>
        7-26-19<br>
        The best, most real, relatable, and reliable people in life are the ones that are less-than-perfect and realize it. The kind of people that just crack stupid jokes with you and endure what the world throws at them the best way they can.<br>
        7-25-19<br>
        It will always be like this. You walk frantically down a path, and when you feel as though you've forgotten something and look back to see what it is, you'll see a pile of things you had to leave behind so you could walk the path you chose. Things that are too precious to forget or to throw away. But, you cannot retrace your steps, nor stop walking. Just bear all of your regrets, bury your lingering desires, and though you may look back again and again, you can only continue walking. From now on you'll only be leaving even more precious and important things behind, but you must keep your head down and go on, beleiving that the path you walk is worth all the sacrifice.<br>
        7-24-19<br>
        Real courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.<br>
        7-23-19<br>
        You don't deserve this big Toblerone.<br>
        7-22-19<br>
        Oh boy, another reason to never close my eyes ever ever again.<br>
        7-21-19<br>
        If I had a nickel for every fuck I give about you or your problems, I'd be $20 in the hole right now.<br>
        7-20-19<br>
        I think it's absurd that people are still flogging each other about conflicts that have been dead for 100+ years, don't you?<br>
        7-19-19<br>
        Ever think, "Well fuck me, you've got the IQ of a crayon"? That's your lifestyle when you work in the public sector.<br>
        7-18-19<br>
        Sometimes there are useless or even outright harmful parents in this world.<br>
        7-17-19<br>
        One of these days I'm not going to even bother waking up and make up for all the sleep I've been missing out on.<br>
        7-16-19<br>
        One day, I'm going to lean back in my chair and be proud of how I have become a better person and a better parent than my parents ever were and ever thought I would be.<br>
        7-15-19<br>
        It's not every day you can be forcibly electrocuted by your friemd and still be on speaking terms after.<br>
        7-14-19<br>
        If your life had a face, I'd punch it in the balls.<br>
        7-13-19<br>
        "Love you, mom!"<br>
        "I don't."<br>
        7-12-19<br>
        Sometimes there aren't even words for something, and any response at all, espescially a feeble attempt at small talk, would be worse than nothing. In times like these silence is the best response.<br>
        7-11-19<br>
        I'm talking about 7-11 slushie blue, like, what flavor is that? Fuckin'....highlighter?<br>
        7-10-19 <br>
        I don't think it's that weird to just walk down the street eating an entire loaf of garlic bread.<br>
        7-9-19<br>
        No matter how many "me"s exist in this body, no matter where I go, and what happens afterwards, no matter... whether you're able to treat me as your friend or not, you will always be my friend. My dear friend that I love more than anything else in this world.<br>
        7-8-19<br>
        Why the long face? Even your guitar looks sad. You can't play good music with a sad-looking guitar!<br>
        7-7-19<br>
        Laughter helps us cope with tragedy. Like an Irish wake.<br>
        7-6-19<br>
        The first draft of everything is shit.<br>
        7-5-19<br>
        Humor is just a way of avoiding the truth. Every broken family has a comedian, they're the one that make jokes so they can lie to themselves and everyone else about the way things really are.<br>
        7-4-19 <br>
        Sometimes the people that are closest to us are also the ones farthest away. <br>
        7-3-19 <br>
        We're gonna go with black magic this time, we'll call you if we need voodoo.

  	No matter what kind of justice we uphold, we are always the villain of someone else's story. <br>
  	6-23-19 <br>
  	In a world of constant tumult, things that didn't change shone like jewels. <br>
  	6-22-19 <br>
  	You go home and you sharpen y'pencils, and if you need any inspiration, just think of how your little babies would look with their faces full of glass. <br>
  	6-21-19 <br>
  	Next time you swing by hell, be sure to bring me something! <br>

      My mom came in and asked me why I was on my knees. <br>
      I tolder I just witnessed the mother of all sick burns. <br>

  	Vraska felt . . . bad? <br>

  	If I were to list three traits that defined me they would be stubborn, prone to swearing, and morally mercurial. <br>

  	We should learn from the hydra. It never plays favorites; it devours everyone equally. <br>
  	6-14-19 <br>
  	There's nothing worse than a piece of shit baby, is there? <br>
  	6-13-19 <br>
  	I just loved watching you all sing along, with these beautiful smiles on your faces, whilst singing, "jump into the ocean...<i>to end it all</i>." <br>
  	6-12-19 <br>
  	I don't remember what I had for breakfast this morning! Forty-five minutes is way back for me! <br>
  	6-11-19 <br>
  	We try and carve a path throught the tall grass, feeling as though no one has ever felt how we feel, terrified of what may be lurking low in the grass on either side of us but just pressing ever onwards with that paleolithic instinct deep within our chromosomes that the only way is forward. That you have to keep going. That eventually you'll stumble upon the edge of the field, hitch a ride from a passing car and meet up with the rest of the gang for tea and sandwiches at the old town hall...and realize that the field is <i>insignificantly</i> miniscule in size, and that there's only one path through the grass, the exact same one that every human has trod before us and will ever after. Just...stumbling blindly along a tiny hyphen between the words "birth" and "death". And when reduced to that level of crisp...simplicity, fear cannot exist. <br>

  	Sir, we don't welcome haters here, so please shut the fuck up and leave. <br>
  	6-6-19 <br>
  	The people that give a fuck about your head will at some point actually see it in real life. Fuck your head and the neck it rode in on! Your vanity is sssssucking up my bandwidth! <br>
  	6-5-19 <br>
  	Sometimes I lay in almost silence <br>
      My mind in almost peace <br>
      Sometimes my life is almost perfect <br>
      Yet sometimes it's in shambles. <br>

      Sometimes I wish there was a better way <br>
      To silence my screams <br>
      Besides a bloodied pillow <br>
      Because sometimes they escape. <br>

      Sometimes I want to exit from <br>
      This theater of life. <br>
      "All the world's a stage", he wrote <br>
      But sometimes I tire of the script. <br>

      I'm supposed to be the responsible one <br>
      But sometimes I want to abandon the cause. <br>
      Sometimes I don't know what I'm fighting for <br>
      Sometimes I think I love the war <br>
      Sometimes I wonder why <br>
      Sometimes I have a lot of fun <br>
      Sometimes I want to live forever <br>
      Sometimes I want to turn and run <br>
      Sometimes I want to die. <br>

  	Here's how this shit went <b><i>down</i></b>.<br>
  	6-1-19 (my (current) height)<br>
  	He was an unexceptional young man...great things were not expected of him. But this adventurer was a little different from the others...He did not let the gods roll the dice. He was not highborn, nor especially capable. Nor did he have any special powers. He might not save the world. He might not even change anything. He was just another pawn. But even so, he did not let the gods roll the dice. Hence, even the gods did not know how his adventires would end. <br>
  	5-31-19 <br>
  	And that's where the story......should end. <br>
  	5-30-19 <br>
  	She thought of Mazirek, of the kraul, of the rest of the Ochran assassins and the malignant Jarad who reigned with casual ruin over the most downtrodden of the downtrodden. She remembered her years of isolation, and the heinous cruelty of the Azorius, and how no group deserved to suffer as much as those who would subjugate her own. Eliminating that hell was all she ever wanted. <br>
  	5-29-19 <br>
  	I appreciate the depravity of noble designs turned to devious ends. <br>

      Rebuilding Earth ought to be a lot more fun than ruining it was. <br>
      5-15-19 <br>
      It’s somewhere in between fanaticism and nihilism that the way of truth and wisdom lies. Or at the very least, the way of peace. <br>

      How we engage with the world is dependent on how we present ourselves to it. We are continuously adjusting to change because if we fail to change, we fail to survive. By nature of you surviving the hell you did, you have changed into someone wiser than before. <br>

      Jace had dozens of questions lined up, all of them severely different from one another in tone, a hodgepodge of inquiries both mundane and fantastical. Did she like books? What were the metaphysical properties of the space between planes of existence? How was planeswalking different from casting a normal spell? What was her favorite dessert? <br>

      Fear is like a fire. If you can control it, it can cook for you. It can heat your house. If you can't control it, it will burn everything around you and destroy you. Fear is your friend and your worst enemy. <br>

      Books can also provoke emotions. And emotions sometimes are even more troublesome than ideas. Emotions have led people to do all sorts of things they later regret-like, oh, throwing a book at someone else. <br>

      Due to my outstanding performance during our last mission, I have been promoted to a full-time member of the group! That means you all should listen to my opinions from now on.

      I found myself thinking about President William McKinley, the third American president to be assassinated. He lived for several days after he was shot, and towards the end, his wife started crying and screaming, "I want to go too! I want to go too!" And with his last measure of strength, McKinley turned to her and spoke his last words: "We are all going.” <br>

      The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. If in loving them we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection of ourselves we find in them. <br>

      This is how it works. I love the people in my life, and I do for my friends whatever they need me to do for them, again and again, as many times as is necessary. For example, in your case you always forget who you are and how much you're loved. So what I do for you as your friend is remind you who you are and tell you how much I love you. And this isn't any kind of burden for me, because I love who you are very much. Every time I remind you, I get to remember with you, which is my pleasure.<br>

      Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time! <br>

      Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. <br>

      Saying 'I notice you're a nerd' is like saying, 'Hey, I notice that you'd rather be intelligent than be stupid, that you'd rather be thoughtful than be vapid, that you believe that there are things that matter more than the arrest record of Lindsay Lohan. Why is that?' In fact, it seems to me that most contemporary insults are pretty lame. Even 'lame' is kind of lame. Saying 'You're lame' is like saying 'You walk with a limp.' Yeah, whatever, so does 50 Cent, and he's done all right for himself. <br>

      Oh, hey, maybe I should have mentioned that my friends are retarded douchebags. <br>

      Every time you look up at the stars, it’s like opening a door. You could be anyone, anywhere. You could be yourself at any moment in your life. You open that door and you realize you’re the same person under the same stars. Camping out in the backyard with your best friend, eleven years old. Sixteen, driving alone, stopping at the edge of the city, looking up at the same stars. Walking a wooded path, kissing in the moonlight, look up and you’re eleven again. Chasing cats in a tiny town,you’re eleven again, you’re sixteen again. You’re in a rowboat. You’re staring out the back of a car. Out here where the world begins and ends, it’s like nothing ever stops happening. <br>

      Remember how far you've come, not just how far you have to go. You are not where you want to be, but neither are you where you used to be. <br>

      Hunter! Point at the mice! <br>

      The decent moderation of today will be the least of human things tomorrow. At the time of the Spanish Inquisition, the opinion of good sense and of the good medium was certainly that people ought not to burn too large a number of heretics; extreme and unreasonable opinion obviously demanded that they should burn none at all. <br>
      11-27-18 <br>
      Rockin' and rollin' my way through town <br>
      Yeah, baby, I get around <br>
      Make mine murder, paint the town red <br>
      Squash any spider, hanging by a thread <br>

      “Don’t worry, Jiro. The kami would never attack us this close to home… Jiro?” <br>
      -Hoto, temple guardian, last words <br>
      11-25-18 <br>
      Home is behind, the world ahead, <br>
      And there are many paths to tread <br>
      Through shadow, to the edge of night <br>
      Until the stars are all alight. <br>
      Mist and shadow, cloud and shade, <br>
      All shall fade, all shall fade. <br>
      11-24-18 <br>
      No one has a perfect life. Everybody has something that he wishes was not the way it is. <br>
      11-23-18 <br>
      In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on. <br>
      11-22-18 <br>
      Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. <br>
      11-21-18 <br>
      No more fear. No more failure. No more death. No more! <br>
      11-20-18 <br>
      A full belly is worth little where the mind is starved. <br>
      11-19-18 <br>
      All that is gold does not glitter, <br>
      Not all those who wander are lost; <br>
      The old that is strong does not wither, <br>
      Deep roots are not reached by the frost. <br>
      From the ashes a fire shall be woken, <br>
      A light from the shadows shall spring; <br>
      Renewed shall be blade that was broken, <br>
      The crownless again shall be king. <br>
      11-18-18 <br>
      A room without books is like a body without a soul. <br>
      11-17-18 <br>
      Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. <br>
      11-16-18 <br>
      The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool. <br>

      It's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring. <br>
      11-14-18 <br>
      The women looked pretty, except when you got near them. <br>
      11-13-18 <br>
      Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe. <br>
      11-12-18 <br>
      Now, think about this. You could walk across the street against a traffic light and get a summons for jaywalking, but you could walk up to a police officer and say “I want to rule the world,” and there’s nothing he can do about it, that is not a crime. Anybody can want to rule the world. <br>
      11-11-18 <br>
      It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light. <br>
      11-10-18 <br>
      My supply of shticks is inexhaustible! <br>
      11-9-18 <br>
      Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships. <br>
      11-8-18 <br>
      We fit like gloves. I think I’m a genius and you agree with me. You’re there for me, and that’s good enough. <br>
      11-7-18 <br>
      A test?! How am I supposed to do a test when I never pay attention in class?!?! <br>
      11-6-18 <br>
      “There’s never anyone home at our house, Noriko-san.” <br>
      “That’s right, because my house embraces liberalism.” <br>
      11-5-18 <br>
      We do not suddenly fall on death, but advance towards it by slight degrees. We die every day. <br>
      11-4-18 <br>
      Crazy’s always better with company. <br>
      11-3-18 <br>
      May you find peace with the knowledge of the good your life has produced rather than the evil into which you were once thrust. <br>
      11-2-18 <br>
      I am on my way to hell, that is, if I am on the right road. <br>
      11-1-18 <br>
      Besides, where better to put a village than where no one is looking?  And where better to place a path than where no one expects it? <br>
      10-31-18 <br>
      This isn't the first time I've worn dead bodies as clothes. Might be the most fun I've had though. Top three at least. <br>
      10-30-18 <br>
      Did it just get badass in here? <br>
      10-29-18 <br>
      We’re stuck on a giant floating sphere in the middle of an endless universe. It’s okay to feel a little lost sometimes. <br>
      10-28-18 <br>
      Some inner voice told me to be cool. I went full fangirl instead. <br>
      10-27-18 <br>
      The only thing you really need to know is the location of the library. <br>
      10-26-18 <br>
      Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind. <br>
      10-25-18 <br>
      I don’t know about everything, not by a long shot. But I do try to keep an open mind, and you’d be surprised by what wanders in sometimes. <br>
      10-24-18 <br>
      If you can believe in Santa for years, you can believe in yourself for a bit. <br>
      10-23-18 <br>
      It’s better to eat an egg then not to. <br>
      10-22-18 <br>
      Many say only God can judge. I don’t think He issues restraining orders. <br>
      10-21-18 <br>
      Hey, laser lips! Your mama’s a snow blower! <br>
      10-20-18 <br>
      Man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed, but not defeated. <br>
      10-19-18 <br>
      The closer one gets to the light, the stronger one’s shadow gets. <br>

      Many a book is like a key to unknown chambers within the castle of one's own self. <br>
      10-16-18 <br>
      Oh, I just knew you could do it! And both of you are still alive, with intestines intact and all!  Marvelous! <br>
      10-15-18 <br>
      It's a man's curse to see himself only as that which he lacks, and it's his blessing to have friends that have the wisdom to see him as he really is. <br>
      10-12-18 <br>
      Every spirit builds itself a house; and beyond its house, a world; and beyond its world a heaven. Know then, that the world exists for you; build, therefore, your own world. <br>

      By the way, these are QUOTES. Few of these were originally mine, so (since it’s a pain to cite 500 sources) I give credit wherever it is due. <br>
